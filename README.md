#Music Node

##Introduction
This is the source code for my 2010 entry at Yahoo! Hack U at CMU. The project contains a server side Node.js file server.js, and others are client side files. Obligatory, fu.js and server.js lifts a big chunk from the Node.js demo chat server and the painting code is lifted off my friend's [jTenori](http://jabtunes.com/notation/flashtest/jtenorion.html)

Not too bad for a 20 hour code although the quality remains much to be desired. The algorithm is not very good and I probably thought of a few better algorithms. Anyhow, do take a look if you're interested.
